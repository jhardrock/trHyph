trHyph.py is a **python** script for generating a TeX-compliant Turkish hyphenation pattern dictionary.

The dictionary is meant to be all-inclusive, containing all possibilities of letter combinations that form syllables, some of them even may not appear in Turkish language. 
Foreign words that are used in Turkish are subject to the same hyphenation rules, so the impossible patterns are left untouched.

The script and the generated hyph_tr.dic file are both published under GNU General Public License.
The dictionary file is encoded in iso8859_9.
